## Description

The goal for this project was to build a weather dashboard using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The user can input a city and submit a search for the current day's weatheras well as the 5-day forecast for that particular city. The user's search history is kept in a list and also displayed once a search is done. The user may click on a city in the search history list to display that city's weather data again. Each search is stored into local storage which allows the city to remain in the history if the page is reloaded.
